## Agenda for Part I

2. Creating and using custom security policies
3. Using Azure Lighthouse to enable multi-tenant cloud security posture management
4. The power of automation
5. Leveraging Azure Arc to enable Defender for Cloud across hybrid and multicloud
6. Better Together - Connecting Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Microsoft Sentinel
7. Certification and Training

## Labs
The labs require access to an Azure tenant. Use a non-production subscripition for learning. The CSPM labs should not add additional costs beyond superficial amounts for items like logic apps. The CSPM labs require cloud workload protection features to be enabled, which are not free outside of a trial.
