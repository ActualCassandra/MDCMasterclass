## Agenda for Part I
Part I covers cloud security posture management (CSPM):
1. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview, including Azure Lighthouse and Azure Arc
2. Extending Microsoft Defender for Cloud beyond Azure
3. Creating and using custom regulatory compliance policies
4. The power of automation
5. Certification and Training

## Labs
The labs require access to an Azure tenant as well as GCP and AWS if you wish to try the multicloud integration. There are some small potential costs on AWS and GCP (aside from test VMs etc if you create these), but on the workload protection side if you enable the trial and disable any features you have enabled before the 30 days are up you should be fairly safe.

### Part I
